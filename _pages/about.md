Hi! This is Yulong! I am now a third year Ph.D. candidate at SmartCity Lab of The Hongkong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), with the insightful guidance of [Prof. Sen Li](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/sen-li), and support of Hong Kong Ph.D. Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS). My research interests mainly lie in Reinforcement Learning (RL) control for emerging transportation and energy systems like smarty mobility and distributed energy resources. I also have visited Kings College London (KCL) and Univeristy College London (UCL) to work and study with [Prof. Yali Du](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/yali-du) and [Prof. Boli Chen](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/72618) on Multiagent Reinforcement Learning and Control respectively.

Before embarking on my doctoral journey, I completed my bachelor study in Electrical Engineering and Automation with Hongshen Honor degree at Chongqing University. I was also exchange undergraduate student in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) and Mathematics at The University of Hong Kong (HKU), respectively. I also had the honor to work with [Prof. Francesco Iannuzzo](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/fia) at AAU Energy of Aalborg University.
