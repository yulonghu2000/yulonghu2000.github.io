Hi! This is Yulong! I am now a fourth year Ph.D. candidate at SmartCity Lab of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), with the insightful guidance of [Prof. Sen Li](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/sen-li), and support of Hong Kong Ph.D. Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS). I am also currently a visiting student at Swiss Federal Technology Institute of Lausanne (EPFL), hosted by [Prof. Nikolas Geroliminis](https://people.epfl.ch/nikolas.geroliminis) My research interests mainly lie in Reinforcement Learning (RL) control for emerging transportation and energy systems like smarty mobility and distributed energy resources. I also have visited University College London (UCL) at Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and Kings College London (KCL) at Department of Informatics, hosted by [Prof. Boli Chen](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/72618-boli-chen) and [Prof. Yali Du](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/yali-du), to study and work on Control and Multiagent Reinforcement Learning respectively.

Before embarking on my doctoral journey, I completed my bachelor study in Electrical Engineering and Automation with Hongshen Honor degree at Chongqing University. I was also exchange undergraduate student in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) and Mathematics at The University of Hong Kong (HKU), respectively. I also had the honor to work at AAU Energy of Aalborg University on aging monitoring and thermal control of power electronics equipment for EV drive system.

In my spare time, I enjoy going to the gym, swimming, listening to music, singing, and both watching and playing DOTA2. Thanks to my family, I’m also lucky to have two adorable cats and a playful corgi at home.
