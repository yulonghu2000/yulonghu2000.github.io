Hi! This is Yulong! I am now a fourth year Ph.D. candidate at SmartCity Lab of The Hongkong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), with the insightful guidance of [Prof. Sen Li](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/sen-li), and support of Hong Kong Ph.D. Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS). My research interests mainly lie in Reinforcement Learning (RL) control for emerging transportation and energy systems like smarty mobility and distributed energy resources. I also have visited University College London (UCL) at Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and Kings College London (KCL) at Department of Informatics, to study and work on Control and Multiagent Reinforcement Learning respectively.

Before embarking on my doctoral journey, I completed my bachelor study in Electrical Engineering and Automation with Hongshen Honor degree at Chongqing University. I was also exchange undergraduate student in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) and Mathematics at The University of Hong Kong (HKU), respectively. I also had the honor to work at AAU Energy of Aalborg University on aging monitoring and thermal control of power electronics equipment for EV drive system.

In my spare time, I enjoy going to the gym, swimming, listening to music, singing, and both watching and playing DOTA2. Thanks to my family, I’m also lucky to have two adorable cats and a playful corgi at home.
